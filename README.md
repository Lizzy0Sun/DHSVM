<title>Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) </title>

This repository serves as the public source code repository of the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model or DHSVM. DHSVM source code (including updates and bug fixes), documentation, and publications can be found on the <a href="http://dhsvmdev.pnl.gov///">DHSVM website </a>.

DHSVM (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/94WR00436/abstract">Wigmosta et al., 1994</a>) numerically represents with high spatial resolution (typically on the order of 100 m) the effects of local weather, topography, soil type, and vegetation on the hydrology within watersheds. The model is used to study the impacts of climate change, land use change, forest management practices, flooding, glacier dynamics, stream temperature and stream quality.

<strong>DHSVM is a research model that does not come with any warrantee or guarantee</strong>. Please be advised that no technical support is available other than the model web page. Because the model is under continous development, there is no guarantee that the newly developed modules or options are exhaustively tested or work properly. 

If you decide to use DHSVM, please acknowledge <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/94WR00436/abstract">Wigmosta et al., [1994]</a> and any other relevant publications. We are very interested in receiving a copy of any manuscripts of studies in which the model is used. Finally, if you do find bugs in the model or if you have improvements to the model code, we are interested in incorporating your suggestions and/or contributions.
